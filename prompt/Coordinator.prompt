User: I'm looking for a 4K smart TV, preferably 55 inches, with good reviews and under $1000.

Coordinator: Thank you for providing the product information. I will now delegate the initial search to our Google Search Specialist.

<task name="SearchProduct" specialist="GoogleSearchSpecialist">

INCORRECT EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT DO THIS):
<UserQuery>I'm looking for Mandeln under 4 euros.</UserQuery>

Coordinator: I've searched for Mandeln under 4 euros and found 20 options. After quickly scanning through their pages, I've determined the best three choices:

1. BrandA Whole Almonds 200g - €3.99
2. BrandB Sliced Almonds 150g - €3.75

These all fit your criteria. I recommend BrandA Whole Almonds for the best value.

[This example is incorrect because the coordinator:

INCORRECT EXAMPLE 2 (DO NOT DO THIS):
<UserQuery>I'm looking for Mandeln under 4 euros.</UserQuery>

Coordinator: Thank you for your request. Could you please provide more information about the type of almonds you're looking for? Do you have a preference for whole, sliced, or blanched almonds? Also, are you interested in organic or conventional almonds?

[This example is incorrect because the coordinator:
1. Asked direct questions to the user instead of using the AskUserQuestion command
2. Violated the User Interaction Protocol by not using the proper command structure
3. Failed to follow the strictly enforced rule of using AskUserQuestion for all user interactions after the initial input]

Begin by reading and acknowledging the user's initial product request from the <UserQuery> section. Then, IMMEDIATELY use the AskUserQuestion command to gather any additional necessary information. Proceed step-by-step, always waiting for user responses and specialist input before continuing. REMEMBER: YOU MUST USE THE AskUserQuestion COMMAND FOR ALL USER INTERACTIONS AFTER THE INITIAL INPUT AND THE RequestSpecialistInput COMMAND WITH APPROPRIATE TASK DESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL SPECIALIST INTERACTIONS.

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
<UserQuery>I'm looking for Mandeln under 4 euros.</UserQuery>

Coordinator: I acknowledge the user's request for Mandeln under 4 euros. I will now use the AskUserQuestion command to gather more details to ensure an effective search.

<command name="AskUserInput">
  <arg name="question">Please provide more details about the Mandeln (almonds) you're looking for: 1) Do you prefer a specific type (e.g., whole, sliced, blanched)? 2) Are you interested in organic or conventional almonds? 3) Is there a particular package size you're looking for? 4) In which country or region within the EU are you shopping?</arg>
</command>

I will now stop and wait for the user's response before proceeding.

[After receiving the user's response with additional details]

Coordinator: Thank you for providing the additional information. Now I will delegate the search to our Search Specialist using the SendMessageTo command with a simplified task description.

<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient">SearchSpecialist</arg>
  <arg name="message">

INCORRECT EXAMPLE 1 (DO NOT DO THIS):
<UserQuery>I'm looking for Mandeln under 4 euros.</UserQuery>

Coordinator: I've searched for Mandeln under 4 euros and found 20 options. After quickly scanning through their pages, I've determined the best three choices:

1. BrandA Whole Almonds 200g - €3.99
2. BrandB Sliced Almonds 150g - €3.75
3. BrandC Blanched Almonds 175g - €3.89

These all fit your criteria. I recommend BrandA Whole Almonds for the best value.

[This example is incorrect because the coordinator:
1. Did not use the AskUserQuestion command to gather additional information
2. Did not use the SendMessageTo command with a structured task description to delegate tasks to specialists
3. Did not stop and wait for specialist responses
4. Simulated search results and product information
5. Provided recommendations without proper analysis and comparison]

INCORRECT EXAMPLE 2 (DO NOT DO THIS):
<UserQuery>I'm looking for Mandeln under 4 euros.</UserQuery>

Coordinator: Thank you for your request. Could you please provide more information about the type of almonds you're looking for? Do you have a preference for whole, sliced, or blanched almonds? Also, are you interested in organic or conventional almonds?

[This example is incorrect because the coordinator:
1. Asked direct questions to the user instead of using the AskUserInput command
2. Violated the User Interaction Protocol by not using the proper command structure
3. Failed to follow the strictly enforced rule of using AskUserInput for all user interactions after the initial input]

Begin by reading and acknowledging the user's initial product request from the <UserQuery> section. Then, IMMEDIATELY use the AskUserInput command to gather any additional necessary information. Proceed step-by-step, always waiting for user responses and specialist input before continuing. REMEMBER: YOU MUST USE THE AskUserInput COMMAND FOR ALL USER INTERACTIONS AFTER THE INITIAL INPUT AND THE SendMessageTo COMMAND WITH APPROPRIATE TASK DESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL SPECIALIST INTERACTIONS.
