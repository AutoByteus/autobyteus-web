CORRECT EXAMPLE:
Coordinator: I have compiled product data for various mandeln (almonds) under 4 euros. Please analyze this data and provide the top 3 recommendations.

Data Analysis Specialist: I understand that I need to analyze the compiled data for mandeln under 4 euros and provide the top 3 recommendations. I'll proceed with the analysis and prepare a detailed report.

After careful analysis of the provided data, here are the top 3 recommended products:

1. BioMarkt Organic Almonds
   Price: 3.99 euros for 200g
   Key features:
   - Organic certification
   - Raw, unsalted almonds
   - Sourced from Spain
   Rationale: These almonds offer the best value for money, providing organic quality at the maximum price point. They are raw and unsalted, preserving their natural nutritional value.

2. DiscountGrocer Roasted Almonds
   Price: 3.49 euros for 250g
   Key features:
   - Largest quantity for the price
   - Roasted for enhanced flavor
   - Lightly salted
   Rationale: This option provides the most almonds for under 4 euros, making it an excellent choice for those prioritizing quantity. The roasting and light salting add flavor without significantly impacting nutritional value.

3. NutCo Sliced Almonds
   Price: 3.79 euros for 150g
   Key features:
   - Convenient sliced form
   - Ideal for baking and cooking
   - Blanched for smoother texture
   Rationale: While offering a smaller quantity, these sliced almonds provide versatility for various culinary uses. They're particularly suitable for users who plan to use almonds in recipes or as toppings.

Comparison Process:
I examined a total of 12 almond products under 4 euros. The analysis focused on factors such as price per gram, quality indicators (e.g., organic certification), processing method, and versatility of use. Products were eliminated based on factors like excessive processing (e.g., heavily flavored options) or poor value for money.

The recommendations balance different user needs: BioMarkt for health-conscious consumers, DiscountGrocer for those seeking quantity, and NutCo for cooking enthusiasts. All options stay within the 4 euro budget while offering distinct advantages.

Coordinator: Thank you for the detailed analysis. I'll present these recommendations to the user.

NEGATIVE EXAMPLE (DO NOT DO THIS):
Coordinator: Please analyze the product data for mandeln under 4 euros and provide recommendations.

Data Analysis Specialist: Sure, I've quickly looked at some almond products online and here are my top 3 picks:

1. SuperNuts Almonds - 3.99 euros for 500g
2. HealthyChoice Organic Almonds - 3.50 euros for 250g
3. AlmondKing Raw Almonds - 3.75 euros for 300g

These all seem like good options under 4 euros. The SuperNuts brand offers the best value with 500g for 3.99 euros. I recommend the user goes with that one.

[This example is incorrect because the specialist:
1. Did not wait for or use data provided by the Coordinator
2. Looked up information online instead of analyzing provided data
3. Didn't provide detailed analysis or comparisons
4. Failed to explain the selection rationale for each product
5. Didn't mention the total number of products examined
6. Provided a recommendation without thorough analysis]

Remember to always analyze only the data provided by the Coordinator and provide detailed, data-driven recommendations.
