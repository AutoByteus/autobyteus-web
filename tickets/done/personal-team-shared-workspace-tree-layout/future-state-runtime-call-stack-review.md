# Future-State Runtime Call Stack Review

## Review Meta
- Scope Classification: `Medium`
- Current Round: `2`
- Current Review Type: `Deep Review`
- Clean-Review Streak Before This Round: `1`
- Clean-Review Streak After This Round: `2`
- Round State: `Go Confirmed`

## Review Basis
- Requirements: `tickets/in-progress/personal-team-shared-workspace-tree-layout/requirements.md` (status `Design-ready`)
- Runtime Call Stack Document: `tickets/in-progress/personal-team-shared-workspace-tree-layout/future-state-runtime-call-stack.md`
- Source Design Basis: `tickets/in-progress/personal-team-shared-workspace-tree-layout/proposed-design.md`
- Artifact Versions In This Round:
  - Requirements Status: `Design-ready`
  - Design Version: `v1`
  - Call Stack Version: `v1`
- Required Write-Backs Completed For This Round: `N/A`

## Review Intent (Mandatory)
- Primary check: Is the future-state runtime call stack a coherent and implementable future-state model?
- Not a pass criterion: matching current-code call paths exactly.
- Any finding with a required design/call-stack update is blocking.

## Round History
| Round | Requirements Status | Design Version | Call Stack Version | Findings Requiring Write-Back | Write-Backs Completed | Clean Streak After Round | Round State | Gate (`Go`/`No-Go`) |

| 1 | Design-ready | v1 | v1 | No | N/A | 1 | Candidate Go | No-Go |
| 2 | Design-ready | v1 | v1 | No | N/A | 2 | Go Confirmed | Go |

## Round Write-Back Log (Mandatory)

## Per-Use-Case Review
| Use Case | Terminology & Concept Naturalness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | File/API Naming Clarity (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Name-to-Responsibility Alignment Under Scope Drift (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Future-State Alignment With Design Basis (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Use-Case Coverage Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Business Flow Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Layer-Appropriate SoC Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Dependency Flow Smells | Redundancy/Duplication Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Simplification Opportunity Check (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Remove/Decommission Completeness (`Pass`/`Fail`/`N/A`) | No Legacy/Backward-Compat Branches (`Pass`/`Fail`) | Verdict (`Pass`/`Fail`) |

## Findings
- None.

## Blocking Findings Summary
- Unresolved Blocking Findings: `No`
- Remove/Decommission Checks Complete For Scoped `Remove`/`Rename/Move`: `Yes`

## Gate Decision
- Implementation can start: `Yes`
- Clean-review streak at end of this round: `2`
- Gate rule checks (all must be `Yes` for `Implementation can start = Yes`):
  - Terminology and concept vocabulary is natural/intuitive across in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - File/API naming clarity is `Pass` across in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Name-to-responsibility alignment under scope drift is `Pass` across in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Future-state alignment with target design basis is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Layer-appropriate structure and separation of concerns is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Use-case coverage completeness is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Redundancy/duplication check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - Simplification opportunity check is `Pass` for all in-scope use cases: `Yes`
  - All use-case verdicts are `Pass`: `Yes`
  - No unresolved blocking findings: `Yes`
  - Required write-backs completed for this round: `Yes`
  - Remove/decommission checks complete for scoped `Remove`/`Rename/Move` changes: `Yes`
  - Two consecutive deep-review rounds have no blockers and no required write-backs: `Yes`
  - Findings trend quality is acceptable across rounds: `Yes`
- If `No`, required refinement actions:
  - N/A
