# UI Behavior Test Matrix

| transition_id | flow | screen | trigger | from_state | to_state | expected next state image | acceptance check | open question / risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `server_settings_quick_default` | server-settings | server-settings | `system:open-server-settings-quick` | `none` | `quick_default` | `server-settings-quick-default.png` | Quick tab is active; each service card shows structured endpoint row controls; no comma-separated input field. | Image model text fidelity may vary. |
| `server_settings_switch_to_advanced` | server-settings | server-settings | `click:advanced-developer-tab` | `quick_default` | `advanced_default` | `server-settings-advanced-developer-default.png` | Advanced tab appears selected; developer tools table is visible with raw setting controls. | Generated labels may not perfectly match source copy. |
| `server_settings_switch_to_quick` | server-settings | server-settings | `click:quick-setup-tab` | `advanced_default` | `quick_default` | `server-settings-quick-default.png` | Switching back to quick setup restores guided endpoint cards. | No additional state persistence modeled in static prototype. |
| `server_settings_add_endpoint_focus` | server-settings | server-settings | `click:add-endpoint-auto-llm` | `quick_default` | `quick_add_endpoint_focus` | `server-settings-quick-add-endpoint-focus.png` | New endpoint row appears for AutoByteus LLM and host field has focus affordance. | Add-row placement can drift in generated visuals. |
| `server_settings_endpoint_validation_error` | server-settings | server-settings | `blur:empty-host-or-invalid-port` | `quick_add_endpoint_focus` | `quick_validation_error` | `server-settings-quick-validation-error.png` | Invalid fields are highlighted with per-field messages and save affordance is blocked for invalid row. | Exact copy may vary due generation model OCR quality. |
| `server_settings_save_all_loading` | server-settings | server-settings | `click:save-all-changes` | `quick_validation_error` | `quick_saving` | `server-settings-quick-saving.png` | Save action enters loading state; controls visibly disabled or busy. | Spinner placement may differ by render pass. |
| `server_settings_save_all_success` | server-settings | server-settings | `system:save-complete` | `quick_saving` | `quick_save_success` | `server-settings-quick-save-success.png` | Success confirmation is visible (inline and/or toast); card status indicates saved. | Toast position and wording may vary by generation pass. |

| `server_settings_provider_cards_simplified_v2` | server-settings | server-settings | `system:apply-user-feedback-simplify` | `quick_default` | `quick_provider_cards_simplified_v2` | `server-settings-quick-provider-cards-simplified-v2.png` | Four clear provider cards remain (LM Studio, Ollama, AutoByteus LLM Hosts, AutoByteus VNC Hosts), top wording simplified to "Endpoints". | Final copy polish may still be needed for production text quality. |
