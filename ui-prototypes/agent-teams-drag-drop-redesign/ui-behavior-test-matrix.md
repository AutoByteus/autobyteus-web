# UI Behavior Test Matrix

| flow | screen | trigger | expected next state image | acceptance check | open question / risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| agent-teams-management | agent-teams-list-redesign (default) | User scans team inventory | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-teams-list-redesign-default.png` | Simple name search and card metadata make team differences clear in under 5 seconds. | Should we expose "last run" status on each card or keep details minimal? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-teams-list-redesign (default) | User chooses a team to run | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-teams-list-redesign-default.png` | Primary Run action is dominant; secondary Edit/Details do not compete visually. | Should Run include a quick config popover entry point? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-builder-drag-drop (default) | User drags an agent/team into canvas | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-builder-drag-drop-default.png` | Drag source (left library) and drop target (center canvas) are explicitly labeled; newly placed members show role/type and removable handles immediately. | Should canvas order imply execution order or only membership grouping? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-builder-drag-drop (default) | User assigns coordinator from placed member card | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-builder-drag-drop-default.png` | Coordinator assignment is one click inline and visually persistent. | Should coordinator assignment be limited to AGENT members only in UI copy? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-builder-drag-drop (default) | User attempts submit without valid composition | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-builder-drag-drop-default.png` | Validation strip explains exact missing requirement and keeps CTA disabled. | Do we need dedicated empty-state education for nested teams? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-builder-drag-drop (default) | User reaches footer actions | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-builder-drag-drop-default.png` | Cancel/Create Team appear in the builder footer attached to content, not detached at outer window edge. | Should footer remain sticky when canvas scrolls with many members? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-builder-drag-drop (default) | User sets team identity | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-builder-drag-drop-default.png` | Team avatar upload and preview are clearly discoverable in basics row. | Should we support drag-and-drop image upload in addition to file picker? |
| agent-teams-management | agent-team-detail-redesign (default) | User opens a team detail page | `images/web/agent-teams-management/agent-team-detail-redesign-default.png` | Team identity (avatar/name/role), actions, and member structure are readable at a glance. | Should member rows support inline expand for more metadata? |
